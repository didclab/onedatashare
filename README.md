# OneDataShare #

OneDataShare (abbreviated as ODS) is a cloud-based managed file transfer system that performs inter-protocol data transfers in a reliable and efficient manner.

ODS provides the end-user with an interface which can be used to initiate file transfers and monitor them simultanously. ODS guarantees efficiency in data transfer by performing software level optimizations (for example - chunking of data into a byte stream of fixed size).

1. Dropbox
2. Google Drive

7. HTTP

_Note: Box and Amazon S3 endpoints support will be provided in future releases_
