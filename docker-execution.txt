Continuation to installation steps mentioned in README file.  

Please ensure that Docker (Docker CE is being used currently)is installed on your host machine.

1. Get respective .env file and place it into the project's root directory.

2. In the project root directory(where the docker-compose.yml is) run "docker-compose up"

4. Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080


Note -  
The first run of step 3 will require a significant amount of time since it creates the containers from the base Docker images, makes necessary configurations and downloads all the maven dependencies.  
Subsequent runs will be quick since the configured containers are already available and Docker just starts up those containers.
